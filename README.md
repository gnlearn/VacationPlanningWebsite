# VacationPlanningWebsite
My software engineering team and I developed and deployed a vacation planning website using Microsoft Azure. The website features an introductory form on the homepage where users input their starting point and destination. From there, they can explore three key pages:

1. Events Tab: Displays activities and attractions in the destination area, web-scraped from the internet, complete with titles and images.

2. Flights Tab: Provides flight options tailored to the userâ€™s departure date and pricing preferences, powered by the "Flight API."

3. Hotels Tab: Lists hotels with pricing details and direct booking links, utilizing the Makcorps.com Hotel API.

This project gave me valuable experience running code in a Flask environment, enhancing my backend Python skills, integrating a Microsoft Database for sign in and session tokens, and learning HTML and CSS. Additionally, it strengthened my ability to collaborate, lead a team, and deliver a functional product.
